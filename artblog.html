  <h3 class="artfirst">Art</h3>

  <p class="explanation">
 Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface.
<br>
 The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, 
<br> 
but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. The final work is also called a painting.
<br>
Painting is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing,
 gesture (as in gestural painting),
<br>
 composition, narration (as in narrative art), or abstraction (as in abstract art).
<br>
 Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a still life or landscape painting),
<br>
 photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism), or political in nature (as in Artivism).
<br>
A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art.
<br>
 Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, 
<br>
to Biblical scenes Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the life of Buddha or other images of 
Eastern religious origin.
<br>
In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action. The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas,

<br>
 wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate 
<br>
multiple other materials including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, as well as object.

  <h3 class="artfirst">History</h3>

  <p class="explanation">

    The oldest known paintings are at the Grotte Chauvet in France, which some historians believe are about 32,000 years old.
<br>
 They are engraved and painted using red ochre and black pigment,
<br>
 and they show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth, abstract designs and what are 
possibly partial human figures. 
<br>
However, the earliest evidence of the act of painting has been discovered in two rock-shelters 
<br>
in Arnhem Land, in northern Australia. 
<br>
In the lowest layer of material at these sites, there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old.
<br>
 Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the Kimberley region of North-Western Australia,
<br>
 that is dated 40,000 years old.
<br>
There are examples of cave paintings all over the world—in Italy, France, Spain,
<br>
 Portugal, China, Australia, Mexico, etc. 
<br>
In Western cultures, oil painting and watercolor painting have rich and complex traditions in style 
and subject matter. 
<br>
In the East, ink and color ink historically predominated the choice of media, 
<br>
with equally rich and complex traditions.
<br>

The invention of photography had a major impact on painting. In the decades after the
<br>
 first photograph was produced in 1829, photographic processes improved and became more 
<br>
widely practiced, depriving painting of much of its historic purpose to provide an accurate record 
of the observable world.
<br>

 A series of art movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
<br>
notably Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, and Dadaism
<br>
challenged the Renaissance view of the world.
<br>
 Eastern and African painting, however, continued a long history of stylization and did not undergo an equivalent transformation at the same time
<br>.
Modern and Contemporary Art has moved away from the historic value of craft and
<br>
 documentation in favour of concept. This has not deterred the majority of living painters from 
<br>
continuing to practice painting either as whole or part of their work. The vitality and versatility of 
<br>
painting in the 21st century defies the previous "declarations" of its demise. In an epoch 
<br>
characterized by the idea of pluralism, there is no consensus as to a representative style of the age. 
<br>
Artists continue to make important works of art in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments—their merits are left to the public and the marketplace to judge.
